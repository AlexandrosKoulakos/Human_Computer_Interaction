# Human Computer Interaction

This repository hosts the semester project in the course of Human Computer Interaction (7th Semester, ECE - NTUA). 
The topic of the project was to design a mobile application that can be useful in daily life. 
Our idea was to build a demo application with which one can use their credit card as public transport ticket and recharge it easily at any time.
Our app also supports NFC mode for the precess of scanning inside the station.
